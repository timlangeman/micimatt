  <p>Every American history buff knows who invented the airplane, the telephone,
  and the light bulb. Americans like to think that their culture incentivizes and
  celebrates those inventors and creative geniuses that have propelled the world
  forward, yet about the piece of technology that has most influenced the world
  in the past 20 years, few Americans can answer the question
  “Who invented the internet?”</p>

  <p>Oh, some people will sarcastically say <strong>“I thought Al Gore invented
  the internet”</strong>, not realizing that the political smear they repeat
  <a title="Snopes debunks the story about Al Gore claiming to have
  invented the Internet" href="//www.snopes.com/quotes/internet.asp"
  target="_blank">detracts from Gore’s very real role</a> in converting the
  military’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET" target="_blank">ARPANET</a>
  into the publicly-available system we today call the internet.</p>

  <p>It is said that <q title="Quote origin: 'victory has a hundred fathers and defeat is an orphan'" 
  cite="https://read.citeit.net/mirror/www.quora.com/Who-said-Success-has-many-fathers-but-failure-is-an-orphan-mirror-edited.html"
  >success has many fathers, but failure is an orphan</q>.
  The history of the Internet is a variation on this theme – the
  internet’s size and complexity required the work of many, but the one
  man whose work is responsible for the web arriving several decades earlier
  than it otherwise would have regards its design as a failure. This is not to
  say that the internet we have today is not impressive or powerful, but as
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Nelson" target="_blank">Ted Nelson</a>
  writes in a <strong>newly-released publication of his 2002 Ph.D. thesis
  <a title="Ted Nelson's 2002 Ph.D. Thesis: Philosophy of Hypertext"
    href="https://www.tedneslon.com/publications/philosophy-of-hypertext"
  target="_blank"><i>“Philosophy of Hypertext”</i></a></strong>, today’s
  internet is tied to bad philosophy – backward ways of thinking that
  limit its potential. Ultimately, the world wide web is informed by the
  philosophical and technical constraints of the past, resulting in a distorted
  media platform.</p>

  <p>Nelson wrote widely about <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Xanadu">Xanadu®</a>
  &mdash; his proposed network of electronic documents &mdash; starting in the
  1960s and 1970s, but the company that was commercializing his system in the 1980s
  fell under financial pressure and a <b>simplified version</b> &mdash;
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web" target="_blank">the world wide web</a> &mdash;
  was adopted instead. Now, years later, Ted Nelson is still advocating a system, very much like
  his original proposal from the 1960s and 1970s. Nelson's system argues for:</p>
  <ul class="disc">
   	<li>a <strong>built-in copyright meter</strong> to compensate creators,</li>
   	<li><strong>permanent, granular addresses</strong> to prevent broken links
  and allow granular annotation and remixing; and </li>
   	<li>a browser that displays <strong>more than one page at a time</strong>, to allow
  readers to navigate more complex works without being disoriented
  by having to follow links away from the main piece they are reading.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Nelson’s central role in the development of the internet is described

  is the person who most envisioned what we today think of as the internet.
  His insight was the result of an epiphany he had while a graduate student
  at Harvard in 1960. I leave it as an open invitation to scholars
  to explain the full source of Nelson’s genius; but it is easy to see that
  some of his creativity and early opportunities can be attributed to in his
  <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0625680/" target="_blank">Emmy
  Award-winning</a> television director father, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Nelson"

  target="_blank">Academy Award-winning</a> actress mother,
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celeste_Holm" target="_blank">Celeste Holm</a>,
  who gave him an advantage in envisioning our electronic future. When he was young,
  Nelson had the opportunity to shadow his father on the NBC and CBS
  television sets for shows that his father directed.<a id="note-1-6385" class="footnote" href="#footnote-1-6385">1</a>
  The camera and television monitor were part of his growing up; and he
  directed his own 33-minute film while a senior at
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarthmore_College" target="_blank">Swarthmore
  College</a>. When Ted arrived at Harvard for
  graduate school, it seemed obvious to him that the computer monitors he saw
  *in the Harvard computer lab* were not just displays for textual computer
  output, but had the potential to display movies and all manner of
  electronic media.<a id="note-2-6385" class="footnote" href="#footnote-2-6385">2</a></p>

  <p>Nelson would go on to coin the word
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext" target="_blank">“hypertext”</a>
  which he says <q cite="https://www.openpolitics.com/links/philosophy-of-hypertext-by-ted-nelson-page-53/">came to me in 1962</q>,
  as a way to describe electronic text that can be read non-sequentially using
  connected text which we today think of as
  <a title="a hyperlink, or simply a link, is a reference to data that the reader can directly follow either by clicking, tapping, or hovering." href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink">hyperlinks</a> — those
  typically blue links on the internet that a user can click to access a
  connected page.<a id="note-2b-4321" class="footnote" href="#footnote-2b-4321">3</a>
  In 1974, Nelson would go on to self-publish the classic
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Lib/Dream_Machines"
  target="_blank"><i>Computer Lib/Dream Machines</i></a>,
  which had an enormous impact on the early computer industry. Before
  Steve Jobs and Bill Gates started Apple and Microsoft, Nelson argued
  that the future of computers lay in personal computers (not mainframes)
  and an interconnected network of servers that would convey a
  “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docuverse" target="_blank">docuverse</a>”
  of hypertext media. He called his hypertext system <strong>“Xanadu®”</strong>,
  after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shangdu" target="_blank">the
  capital of Kublai Khan’s dynasty</a> in
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Taylor_Coleridge" target="_blank">Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s</a> poem
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kubla_Khan" target="_blank">“Kubla Khan”</a> about a vision within a
  dream. To Nelson, the Xanadu® Project represents the correct way to do
  hypertext, even though the web has eclipsed it in the public mind.</p>

  <p>Some readers will notice that up until
  this point, I’ve been conflating two terms
  — the “internet”, and the <strong>
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web" target="_blank">
  “world wide web”</a></strong>. Strictly speaking, the
  two are not the same. When most people think about the “internet”,
  they usually do not distinguish between the “world wide web”
  and “the internet”. One can think of <strong>“the internet” as the
  universe of connected computers</strong>, while “the web” represents
  those parts of the internet that can be accessed <strong>through a
  web browser</strong> like Internet Explorer, Safari, Firefox, or
  Chrome.</p>

  you are still on the internet, but outside of the web. This distinction
  is an important concept to understand because
  <span class="highlight"><strong>publishing is moving beyond the web browser</strong></span>

  be available on the web, but books live in the enclosed environment
  of the e-reader; and many magazines offer paid subscriptions to an

  <p>To fully appreciate what the internet is, consider that <strong>the
    internet predated the web</strong>, which <a href="https://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/"
    target="_blank">Tim Berners-Lee</a> released on the internet in 1991.</p>
  <p>The internet started in the early 1960s as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET"
    target="_blank">ARPANET</a>, a military program that implemented
	<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Baran">Paul
    Baran's</a> packet-switching network protocol.  Baran worked at the Rand
    Corporation and was concerned that "one or a few nuclear bombs" would cut off
    communication, preventing diplomats from averting a full-scale nuclear war.<a id="note-5-1234" class="footnote" href="#footnote-5-1234">5</a>
    He and others invented a series of protocols to allow messages
    to be broken into smaller chunks (packets)
    and sent across a network. In the event that one link in the network
    was destroyed, the system would find a way to route around the outage.
    While this was an important breakthrough, it was innovation at the
    <strong>transmission level</strong>, rather than at the <strong>content level</strong>,
    for it did not say anything about how the contents of documents would be
    structured or how the programs that interact with them should function.

  “<strong>jumping into the unknown</strong>.” In place of our current system,
  where the reader inspects the status bar and then blindly “follows” the link based
  upon a guess inferred from the link's URL,
  Ted argues for a system where the linked page would appear
  <strong>alongside the original on the right-hand side.</strong>
  He calls this “<strong>parallel documents</strong>” because you can read
  both the citing and cited documents <strong>together at the same time</strong>. (More on this later)<p>

  </div>
  <p>Tim Berners-Lee was a software engineer at <a href="https://home.web.cern.ch/about" target="_blank">CERN</a>,
  the European Particle Physics Laboratory, who wanted to allow scientists
  to <a href="https://webfoundation.org/about/vision/history-of-the-web/" target="_blank">share reports</a>,
  despite the fact that they operated on different computer systems.
  His goal was not to lay the hypertext foundation of the internet
  for all time; he merely wanted to allow the incompatible computer
  systems at CERN to interoperate, so he took what Ted Nelson had proposed
  for a hypertext system and radically simplified it to create
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML" target="_blank">HTML</a>
  (hyper text markup language – the language web pages are constructed out of).
  “Simplified” sounds good. Nelson says that the web dumbed down his
  ideas to the point where
  <q cite="http://hyperland.com/trollout.txt">Only trivial links are possible</q>.</p>

  </div>
  <p>With the arrival of electronic communication, Nelson had seen an
    opportunity to move beyond many of the conventions of paper. After all, Why
    think about a <strong>“page”</strong> if the text can exist on
    a computer screen?</p>

  <p>Nelson was also working to undo many of the conventions of the computer
  world — one of which was the emphasis on <strong>hierarchy</strong>
  as a design pattern. In place of hierarchy, Nelson posits that the world
  is actually deeply <strong>“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intertwingularity"
  target="_blank">intertwingled</a>”</strong> — a word that he coined
  as part of his philosophy, and which I will explain later in one of the
  optional sections of this article. Before the web, Internet servers
  were (and still are) organized as <strong>hierarchical sets of folders</strong>, similar
  to what Windows and Mac users see when they browse their own hard
  drives. As anyone who has ever tried to locate a file in a deep
  hierarchy knows, the organization of hierarchical folders can be
  unintuitive, even arbitrary. As a demonstration of how abysmal
  hierarchy can be as an organizing principle, consider that it is
  often <strong>easier to find an internet document using google</strong>
  than it is to find a file on a corporate network that resides within a
  series of nested folders.<a id="note-7-6385" class="footnote" href="#footnote-7-6385">7</a>
  This is because there are many different ways
  of organizing hierarchies; and figuring out each organization’s
  taxonomy can be challenging.<p>

  <div class="caption">The web is held together by fragile links.</div>
  </div>
  <p>If hypertext links did not exist, readers on the internet would have to
  manually wade through hierarchical folders and load pages through documents,
  much as is done when accessing folders containing Microsoft Word documents.
  Imagine if the internet was made out of Microsoft Word or PDF documents
  that you could only traverse by manually typing in the URL.
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML" target="_blank">HTML</a>
  provides a document format for the web that allows “pages” to be
  linked together, without all the “hierarchical hell” that computer users
  experience on their personal computers. Though at the fundamental level
  this hierarchy still exists, what Tim Berners-Lee did was to take Nelson’s
  invention and build a web of connections on top of an existing hierarchical
  foundation. We are left today with a way of connecting individual “pages”
  using fragile HTML links, whereas Nelson’s goal was to create unbreakable
  two-way links and eliminate both the hierarchical folders and the metaphor of
  paper.<a id="note-8-6385" class="footnote" href="#footnote-8-6385">8</a><p>

      <div class="caption">Hand in the water</div>
  </div>
  <p><span class="num">1.</span> Nelson’s innovation was shaped by an unlikely
  combination of events, as well as three epiphanies. Nelson writes that the
  first epiphany came when he was very young — perhaps five years old.
  <a id="note-10-6385" class="footnote" href="#footnote-10-6385">10</a>
  Ted was in a rowboat with his grandparents when he paused to observe
  how the water was flowing around his hand as he trailed his hand in the
  water. Though many other boys his age have also trailed their hands in
  water, few have paused to think about all the individual atoms circulating
  around their fingers. Nelson experienced a moment of “awe”, at the amazing
  complexity of the world, where even just the smallest interaction between
  a boy’s hand and water is indescribably complex. Nelson would carry this
  concept of interconnected complexity with him and develop it further when
  he went to college.<a id="note-11-6385" class="footnote" href="#footnote-11-6385">11</a></p>

  <p><span class="num">2.</span> Nelson’s second epiphany occurred while in his
  third year at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarthmore_College"
  target="_blank">Swarthmore College</a>, writing a paper for his philosophy
  class. Nelson concedes that the paper was
<q cite="https://www.openpolitics.com/links/philosophy-of-hypertext-ted-nelson-pg-26/">
 somewhat inspired and sweeping, but not fully baked</q>.
  What made it so ambitious was how it broke from the influence of
  Aristotelian philosophy.</p>
  <p>Aristotle had divided the world into
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categories_(Aristotle)"
    >10 kinds of things</a>.</p>
<ol class="num compact">
  <li>Substance</li>
  <li>Quantity</li>
  <li>Quality</li>
  <li>Relation</li>
  <li>Place</li>
  <li>Time</li>
  <li>Being in Position</li>
  <li>Having (Condition)</li>
  <li>Doing</li>
  <li>Being Affected</li>
</ol>

  <p>Nelson objects to this strict categorization, arguing that the world
  is more properly understood through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heraclitus"
  target="_blank">Heraclitus</a>'s idea of constant change. Heraclitus famously said:</p>

  <div class="alignright">
    <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/openpolitics.com/media/img/ted-nelson-blog/utrecht_moreelse_heraclites-small.jpg" width="250" alt="Heraclitus"/>

  </div>
  <blockquote cite="https://classicalwisdom.com/people/philosophers/heraclitus-535-475-bce/">No man ever steps in the same river twice</blockquote>
  <p>.. meaning that the second time it is not the same river or the same man.</p>
  <p>Nelson also objected to the idea that information could be classified
    into a <strong>single category</strong>.  This seems obvious to computer users who "tag"
    their content with multiple tags rather than assign it to a single category, but at a
    fundamental level, most of our computer systems are based upon the foundation of
    <strong>forcing the real world into a set of hierarchical file folders</strong>.</p>

  <p>Likewise, Nelson argues that in the real world,
  unlike paper, there may be no beginning and no end.
  Yet because of the <strong>linear conventions</strong> imposed
  upon us by the medium of paper, we divide information arbitrarily. (*source*)</p>

  <p>Nelson would describe the writing of his 1958 Schematics paper<a id="note-12-6385"
  class="footnote" href="#footnote-12-6385">12</a>, at the age of 21, this way:</p>
  <blockquote cite="https://www.openpolitics.com/links/philosophy-of-hypertext-by-ted-nelson-page-48/">The experience of writing it was one of the most intense I have ever experienced, in an exalted state of excitement and inspiration. The same epiphany I had experienced at the age of five, of the immensity and indescribability of the world, came to me again, but this time with regard to realizing how models and language and thought worked, a way of approaching the great complexity I had envisioned long before.</blockquote>

    he wrote the <a href="https://billdutton.me/2007/12/10/the-first-rock-musical-remembered-by-ted-nelson/"

    class="footnote" href="#footnote-14-6385">14</a> and then in his
    senior year, Nelson directed a 33 minute film called
    “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFgul6rwNbQ" target="_blank"
    >The epiphany of Slocum Furlow</a>” in which he was able to visualize how
    the film would fit together when edited, a skill completely foreign to
    his fellow Swarthmore students. Though it is unclear whether he ever got
    college credit for all the projects he undertook, the experience of
    directing his own film gave Nelson the confidence that he had the
    innate talent to direct movies, a skill related to, but different from
    his father’s career in network television.</p>

  <h3>How Ted was at the Right Place at the Right Time</h3>
  <p>What is remarkable then, is that despite Nelson's poor undergrad grades,
    one year later he would be <span class="highlight"><strong>admitted to Harvard
    Grad School</strong></span>, where he would work with computers
    in the fall of 1960.
  </p>

  <p>After graduating, Ted met with Ralph (his father) in June of 1959 and was offered a job
    as an actor, although Ted felt that Ralph made the offer in such a
    critical way as to make Ted feel attacked. Ted turned Ralph’s offer
    down and was forced to find summer work on his own as a typist in a
    securities cage on Wall Street.

    <p>In the fall of 1959, Ted began his first year of grad school at the
    University of Chicago studying sociology. In

    href="https://www.lulu.com/shop/ted-nelson/possiplex/paperback/product-14925222.html"
    target="_blank">Possiplex</a>”, Nelson recounts that the year was so awful:
  </p>
  <blockquote cite="https://www.openpolitics.com/links/ted-nelsons-possiplex-pg-94-95/">I constantly felt my father’s curse like a sunlamp close to the back of my neck. I thought of suicide all the time, but I knew what that would do to my grandparents, and so I kept on.</blockquote>

  <p>In 1960, Ted saw an opportunity to <strong>rethink the role of paper</strong>
  in media, because, for him, paper was an obstacle to expressing his thoughts.
  As Ted was composing a written piece he felt constrained by the paper because
  paper forced him to express himself in a <strong>linear pattern</strong>. Rather than writing
  from point A, to point B, Ted’s wanted to express all the related ideas that
  in linear writing are pruned away.</p>

  <p>Unlike the pattern expressed in traditional paper-based writing,
  Nelson believes that ideas are not naturally organized as a linear narrative
  under a series of hierarchical headings or “folders”.
  Rather ideas are “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intertwingularity"
  target="_blank">intertwingled</a>” and any description of a topic
  will follow a web of connections between related topics.</p>

  <p>Whereas Berners-Lee based the world-wide-web upon a simplified
    version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Generalized_Markup_Language"
    target="_blank">SGML</a>, with 1-way links (only going outwards), Nelson
    envisioned a richer version of hypertext
    <a href="https://www.xml.com/pub/a/w3j/s3.nelson.html" target="_blank"
    >without embedded markup</a>:<a id="note-19-6385" class="footnote"
    href="#footnote-19-6385">19</a></p>
  <ul class="disc">
   	<li>Originally, all hypertext used <strong>2-way links</strong>, meaning
      that the reader could see which pages link to the current document,
      not just view links going out from the current page. As the reader
      progresses through a document, the surrounding linked pages
      <a href="https://twitter.com/somaddiesays/statuses/248053025564925952"
      target="_blank">sworph</a> (swoop and morph) into place, displaying
      the linked original text immediately to the right of the citing quote.
      This allows the reader to see the whole context of every idea, which
      is part of what “intertwingularity” is about. As an example, imagine
      that James Fallows wrote a series or “time capsules” chronicling
      moments where American politics moved into uncharted territory.
      <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2016/09/trump-time-capsule-98-the-classified-briefing/499190/"
      target="_blank">Time Capsule #98</a> chronicles Donald Trump
      politicizing the classified briefings he received. Currently, I
      as a reader can view all the outgoing links that James Fallows
      chose. What Xanadu® would easily enable is the <strong>ability to view
      documents that cited Fallows' article</strong>. This would enable readers
      to see a whole other level of potential discussion. For articles
      with many citations, I imagine that browsers and search algorithms
      could be applied to filter the results.
    </li>
   	<li>Documents change as corrections and alterations are made; and
      Nelson was searching for a way to make it easy to view and cite
      any <strong>version</strong> of a page
    </li>
   	<li>As described above, Nelson wanted to be able to view the
      citing work <strong>in parallel with the original</strong>, so
      that he could see the context and inspect the quotation.
      On the web now, it is possible to open a new window, but on a
      long page, it can be difficult for the reader to manually find
      the quoted location and manually compare the citation to the
      original for context and accuracy.
    </li>
   	<li>Nelson’s parallel design calls for a system which would retrieve
      and display the full text of cited documents, appearing to the
      right of the citing document, allowing the reader to see the
      exact context from which the quote was taken. This simple design
      element would have enormous implications for media because so much
      of discourse revolves around the proper meaning and usage of
      excerpts. (* IMAGE *)

      Paper readers can annotate their own paper copy. Web readers cannot 
      unless they print everything they read or copy the article contents
      into Google Docs, as I did to allow reviewers of this article
      to annotate it. Both Vannevar Bush and Nelson planned for
      hypertext readers to be able to make <strong>annotations</strong>
      and <strong>third-party links</strong> as easily as paper
      marginal notes. Bush envisioned note-takers sharing their links
      by hand and Nelson’s plan would have made annotation-sharing a
      major feature of the system. The web would be significantly
      different <span class="highlight"><strong>if anyone could share
      highlights and annotations of any page</strong></span> and the
      search engines/browsers could sift through annotations and return
      the best annotations in the same way they return the best pages.
      There are still plans for an <a href="https://www.w3.org/annotation/"

    <div class="caption">built-in Copyright from the start</div>
  </div>
  <p>To the publishing industry, the idea of an internet with <strong>
    a built-in copyright meter</strong> must sound like a dream; but
    concern for copyright was built into Nelson’s original vision for
    Xanadu® from the beginning. Every letter of every word would be
    metered and a royalty would be instantly paid to the copyright
    holder.<a id="note-20-6385" class="footnote" href="#footnote-20-6385">20</a>
    As of this writing, the articles I’m citing are not available in
    Xanadu® format, but if they were, Nelson has proposed that the
    price would be proportional to the price of a paperback book: If a
    book containing <a href="https://www.writersdigest.com/editor-blogs/guide-to-literary-agents/word-count-for-novels-and-childrens-books-the-definitive-post"
    target="_blank">80,000 words</a> costs $16.00, a 100-word excerpt
    would cost $.02. This price would be paid, not by the writer making
    the excerpt, but by the reader whose computer receives a pointer to
    the cited text and downloads the actual original text.</p>

  <p>If a series of writers quoted a series of sources, each writer’s
    readers would retrieve the cited original,
    compensating the source’s authors according to the amount of the
    original text each was responsible for.

  <p>Another important feature for Nelson was “versioning.” Nelson had
    thought about the publication process enough to think through many of
    the problem areas. One potential problem area occurs when a work links
    to a source that then changes.</p>

  <p>Suppose I write my original version of an article that says
    that Ted Nelson was born in 1939. You quote my article and comment
    about it; and then I correct the figure to 1937. What should the
    reader see? On the web, your copy is uncorrected and the mistake
    propagates to anyone who quoted your article. With Xanadu the new
    version is available, but the old version is not overwritten,
    allowing the system to preserve a history of the article’s past.</p>

  <p>Because Berners-Lee’s world-wide-web was not intended as a
    long-term archive of all knowledge, it does not provide a way of

    break. This has resulted in a problem for both readers and future

  <div id="substruction" class="panel-collapse collapse">
  <div class="panel-body">
    <p>In his <a href="https://www.lulu.com/en/us/shop/theodor-holm-nelson/philosophy-of-hypertext/paperback/product-15v4z6r5.html"
    target="_blank">“Philosophy of Hypertext”</a>, Nelson talks about the
    concept of “<strong>substruction</strong>” — the process of finding
    unifying design patterns that bring together multiple goals to achieve
    a simpler design than would otherwise be possible if these goals
    were pursued independently.</p>
    <div class="alignright">
    <img class="alignright" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/openpolitics.com/media/img/ted-nelson-blog/pac-man.svg"

    <div class="caption"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-Man"
      target="_blank">Pac-man</a> computer game</div>
  </div>

  <p>As an example of substruction, he cites the example of the early
  computer game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-Man"
  target="_blank">“Pac-Man”</a>. Two goals of the design were to
  create a “<strong>maze game</strong>” and a <strong>“chase game”</strong>.
  The question that video game designer
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toru_Iwatani"
  target="_blank">Toru Iwatani</a> faced was how to fit these two goals
  into a single game. The concept he came up with was to create dots to
  be eaten, along with a special type of dot that allows the Pac-Man to
  switch modes and chase the ghosts. Starting from a blank slate, the
  way to unify the modes isn’t obvious, but in hindsight, the special
  dot seems like a natural, or obvious unifying design element. *source*
  <a id="note-21-6385" class="footnote" href="#footnote-21-6385">21</a></p>

  <p>As he was designing his hypertext system, Nelson was committed
    to following good design, guided by heroes like
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Lloyd_Wright"
    target="_blank">Frank Lloyd Wright</a> and
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckminster_Fuller"
    target="_blank">Buckminster Fuller</a>:</p>

  <blockquote cite="https://www.openpolitics.com/links/philosophy-of-hypertext-ted-nelson-pg-66/"
  >Following Bucky Fuller’s point of view, I believed that everything
  would be far better if only it could be redesigned completely.
  </blockquote>
  <p>What Nelson sought was a way to bring all these design goals
    together. An elegant way to:</p>

  <ul class="disc">
   	<li>Link Documents together using 2-way links</li>
   	<li>Keep track of different versions</li>
   	<li>Track copyright usage</li>
   	<li>Support annotations and third-party links as easily as paper marginal notes</li>
   	<li>Display quoted information side by side</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Ted developed the basic design for hypertext using a technique he called
  “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transclusion" target="_blank">transclusion</a>”.
  Transclusion is a way of including content from another
  document or source without making a copy.  In HTML it is possible to
  transclude an image from another website by entering its address in the
  source attribute:</p>

  <p>This is the code to transclude the Pac man image listed above:</p>
  <pre>&lt;img src=&quot;https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pac_Man.svg&quot; /&gt;</pre>

  <p>It is also possible to transclude entire youtube videos using the "embedding"
  feature:  (This is the ABBA video listed above)</p>
  <pre>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot;
  src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/jHYn7LHV7fg&quot;
  frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;</pre>

  <p>A full hypertext system like Xanadu <span class="highlight"><strong>
    would make it possible to embed text</strong></span>
    (all types of content, really) so that the content of a
    citation comes from an original source rather than a
    copy.<a id="note-22-6385" class="footnote" href="#footnote-22-6385">22</a>
    This would allow an author to quote part of a document on the internet
    and have the content pulled from the original. The link between
    the citing document and the source is permanently recorded and
    the author of the cited document is paid whenever readers access
    the citing document. Equally important, the connection between
    the citation and the original is permanently made, allowing the
    web browser to display the connection between the source and
    citation. Web techies may compare it to
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inline_linking"
    target="_blank">“hotlinking”</a>, but the author is paid
    and the system takes care of the hosting.</p>

  </div>
  <p>As Paul Saffo described in the introductory video, Ted
  spent years in the “wilderness” advocating for
  a universal hypertext system and facing the type of obstacles
  that sound archaic today, given our current software ecosystem.
  As Ted recounts in “<a href="//books.tednelsonc.com/possiplex"
  target="_blank">Possiplex</a>”, it was
  much more difficult to make progress building software in the 1960s and 1970s.
  In 1971, Ted got the backing of an investor to rent a computer
  for the development of the “Jot” editor.
  Programmed on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teletype_Model_33"
  target="_blank">33 ASR Teletype</a>
  and a cassette drive, collaborators Cal Daniels, John Ridgway,
  and Harry Mendell developed a text editor that created documents with permanent
  content in a “append-only” writing mode, where all changes were made by adding
  to the end of the file, rather than updating or deleting what had previously been entered.
  (Possiplex 193) This approach was advantageous because it avoided
  the need to rewind the cassette tape while making
  changes. Nelson tried to get his investor to buy the computer for
  $10,000 rather than rent it, but to no avail.
  They returned the machine before their design could be tested. Unfortunately, their program
  only ran on the same type of computer as they had rented because
  popular operating systems like Windows did not exist to bridge incompatibilities
  between different hardware.</p>

  <p>It should also be added that one of Ted's major disadvantages in developing Xanadu was that
  <strong>he was not a programmer</strong>. Ted has said that not learning how to program is one of
  his major regrets, as he had to rely on others to implement designs.
  (<a href="http://ibc.chapman.edu/Mediasite/Play/83d7b9016e3a42ecaf112cc4620e719f1d"
  >Intertwingled Conference Speech</a>: 41 min)</p>

  <p>In the 1960s, Nelson widely underestimated the work required to
  created Xanadu, thinking that it would only take 2 years to create the system
  and then he would retire from the computer field and direct movies.</p>

  <h3>Xanadu® gets Commercial Backing</h3>
  <a title="Autodesk logo" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autodesk"
  target="_blank"><img class="alignright"
  src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/openpolitics.com/media/img/ted-nelson-blog/autodesk-logo-and-wordmark-small.png"
  alt="Autodesk logo" /></a>

  <p>It took *decades* of labor with various
  programmers, most notably <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Gregory_(programmer)"
  target="_blank">Roger Gregory</a>, who headed the project up until 1988, when
  Ted made what he regards to be his biggest mistake.(*source) Nelson had
  gone without financing for Project Xanadu® for the entire time (decades)
  until 1988, when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autodesk"
  target="_blank">Autodesk</a>
  (makers of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AutoCAD" target="_blank">AutoCAD</a>)
  decided to finance an effort to commercialize Ted’s Xanadu® system.
  Papers were signed and a team was formed with the goal of finishing a
  codebase largely written by Roger Gregory.</p>

  <blockquote cite="https://www.openpolitics.com/links/possiplex-ted-nelson-pg-261/">I was told on the phone — I forget by whom — that my good friend Roger Gregory, who was in charge at XOC down south in Palo Alto, was throwing things and acting crazy. I heard that ‘everybody was ready to leave,’ possibly quit within a day or so.</blockquote>
  <p>What Nelson failed to realize was that Roger was upset because the
  other programmers wanted to scrap all the existing code and
  <span class="highlight"><strong>start from scratch</strong></span>
  with a new programming language and design.<a id="note-23-6385"
  class="footnote" href="#footnote-23-6385">23</a> Roger’s goal
  had been to finish off the existing code base and publish within
  a year. The decision to start again from scratch would put them
  in an untenable position four years later, when the revised
  project was still incomplete; and Autodesk cut funding to
  Xanadu® after <strong>Autodesk ran into financial trouble</strong>.</p>
  <h3>Tim Berners-Lee and the Web</h3>

      target="_blank">world-wide-web (www)</a>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Ted Nelson recalls meeting with Tim Berners-Lee a few years later (*fact check*) about
    Berners-Lee’s proposal for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web"
    target="_blank">world-wide-web</a>:
  <blockquote cite="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~ejw/csr/nelson_pg.html"
  >Tim Berners-Lee came and we had lunch, in, oh I guess it was 1989, 90,
  something like that, in Sausalito, and I really liked the guy, and he’d
  done this very simple thing, and it sounded too trivial to me {laughs}
  but he certainly was a nice fellow and I expected to keep in touch with
  him, although I am a very bad correspondent, and the next thing I knew
  suddenly the thing had caught on.
  </blockquote>
  <p>Berners-Lee’s system had none of the advanced features that Ted
    believed were essential for a hypertext system. What’s more, it
    imitated “paper under glass” (*source*).<a id="note-24-6385"
    class="footnote" href="#footnote-24-6385">24</a> There was no ability
    to take marginal notes. There was no version control. You could only
    follow links in one direction. And you could not compare documents
    side by side. Finally, there was no copyright mechanism to
    compensate authors.

  </div>
  <p>There’s a history of ambitious, thoughtful technical projects losing
  out to simpler, corner-cutting designs. In the winter of 1991-92,
  Richard P. Gabriel published a controversial article that captures
  some of the tradeoffs that are involved in making software. The article,
  titled <a href="https://dreamsongs.com/RiseOfWorseIsBetter.html" target="_blank"
  >“The Rise of Worse Is Better”</a>,
  described two systems, dubbed “The Right Thing” and
  “Worse is better.” In the article, Gabriel argues that
  “The Right Thing” is often complex and difficult to create,
  making a system that sacrifices correctness for ease of implementation more
  successful in the marketplace. Though Gabriel later wrote a follow-up
  <a href="https://dreamsongs.com/WorseIsBetter.html" target="_blank">article
  recanting the original</a>, many people still have the impression that it
  is better to make design compromises to ensure that the product gets
  an early foothold in the marketplace.</p>

  <p>Ted's proposed hypertext system had a series of
  <strong>advanced features</strong> like:</p>
  <ul class="disc">
	<li>versioning</li>
    <li>2-way links</li>
	<li>copyright metering</li>
	<li>support for annotations</li>
	<li>support for parallelism: displaying multiple documents side-by-side</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Had Nelson known that people weren’t willing to wait for his
  complete system, he would have been prepared to make compromises
  (*source*) <a id="note-240-6385" class="footnote" href="#footnote-230-6385">23x</a>
  that still would have preserved a lot of potential
  functionality, but he didn’t imagine a hypertext system
  like Berners-Lee’s web would be successful without the
  more sophisticated features.</p>
  <h3>The Legacy of Xerox-PARC</h3>
  <p>Another way of looking at design influences is to consider the influence
  of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PARC_(company)"
  target="_blank">PARC</a> lab on the development of computing.
  Xerox PARC is a research and development lab started by the Xerox
  Corporation, which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PARC_(company)#Accomplishments"
  target="_blank">pioneered the development</a> of:</p>
  <ul class="disc">
   	<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface"
      target="_blank">Graphical user interfaces</a> (GUI): with
      icons and a mouse,
      <a id="note-25-6385" class="footnote" href="#footnote-25-6385">16</a>
    </li>
   	<li>Laser printers,</li>
   	<li>Ethernet (networking), and</li>
   	<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG" target="_blank">WYSIWYG</a>
      text editing, among others.<a id="note-26-6385" class="footnote" href="#footnote-26-6385">26</a></li>
  </ul>
  <div class="alignright">
      <img src="//s3.amazonaws.com/openpolitics.com/media/img/ted-nelson-blog/XeroxPARC-old-logo-small.png" alt="Xerox PARC Logo (old)" />

        target="_blank">old logo</a>)
      </div>
  </div>

  <p>It is the graphical user interface and the WYSIWYG text editor that
  Nelson especially objects to because the development by Xerox PARC, and
  later adoption by Apple and Microsoft *laid the foundation* of our
  <strong>paper simulation paradigm</strong>.</p>

  <p>Xerox’s research and development office was not a disinterested group of
  people searching about for the strictly best way to organize information;
  they were owned by a company that <strong>made money printing things on paper</strong>.
  As Nelson likes to say
  <q cite="https://read.citeit.net/mirror/tprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/11/1/zifty-d9.txt"
  >Xerox was a paper-walloping company</q>.</p>

  <p>The whole point of WYSIWYG is not to represent reality:
  <span class="green-quote">“What You See Is What You Get”</span> is the
  slogan, but the unstated assumption is <span class="green-quote">“What You
  See Is What You Get</span> when you
  <span class="green-quote"><strong>PRINT IT OUT!”</strong></span> (*source*)</p>

Jobs didn’t disappoint his troops. “You’re ripping us off!” he shouted. “I trusted you, and now you’re stealing from us!” Gates just sat there coolly, looking Steve in the eye, before hurling back, in his squeaky voice, what became a classic zinger. “Well, Steve, I think there’s more than one way of looking at it. I think it’s more like we both had this rich neighbor named Xerox and I broke into his house to steal the TV set and found out that you had already stolen it.</blockquote>

  <p>Twitter’s decision to limit their messages to 140 characters is
    more as a result of an <strong>arbitrary legacy design</strong>
    than the influence of research funders’ business interests. That’s
    because <a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-does-Twitter-limit-the-message-length-to-140-characters"
    target="_blank">Twitter’s 140 character limit was devised</a> when
    traffic happened over the telephone <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_Message_Service"

    Twitter didn’t want to have to break their tweets into multiple

    and 140 characters were what remained.</p>

  <p>Recently, Twitter has talked about making changes to that
    limit. In May, they announced that they will

    target="_blank">stop counting photos and links as part of that limit</a>,
    which should make the system friendlier to marketers. Upon
    inspection, it becomes apparent that much of the “architecture”
    we assume to be a <strong>“natural”</strong> part of
    computerization has been influenced by either arbitrary
    <strong>technical</strong> considerations, <strong>bad
      philosophy</strong>,<a id="note-27-6385" class="footnote"

      <h3>A Philosophy of Media</h3>
      <p>When Ted was a grad student at Harvard, the conventional wisdom
        was that computers were just tabulation devices, tools to automate
        calculations; but when Ted saw his first computer screen, he
        realized that “they had been lying” (*source*) &mdash; the potential of
        computers is so much greater than mere calculators.</p>

      </div>
      <p>Already in 1974, Nelson presciently argued in
        “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Lib/Dream_Machines"
        target="_blank">Computer Lib: You Can and Must Understand Computers
        Now</a>” that computers were for everyone (not just big businesses)
    	and that the design of computers is a political act that is too
        important to be left to the techies. Nelson further saw that the book could
        be redefined in a digital era and that authors could be freed to
        write something beyond the confines of linear containers like
        today’s Microsoft Word or the e-book.

  <div id="movie-industry-edl" class="panel-collapse collapse">
  <div class="panel-body">
    <p>The vast majority of people using the world wide
    web consider its imitation of paper to be a success; and even if it is
    not the theoretically “Best” approach, they can’t imagine a viable
    alternative; yet for years the movie industry has used systems that have
    similarities to Nelson’s Xanadu® design. The basic idea is to
    <strong>make references to content rather than copies</strong>.
    In the movie industry, the generic term for this system is called
    <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edit_decision_list" 
      target="_blank">EDL – edit decision list</a></strong>.</p>

  <div class="caption"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xqfmomevMA" target="_blank"
    >What is an EDL?</a></div>
</div>

  <p>What this means for movies is that the producer is given a tool that allows
    them to make a <strong>listing of clips</strong> to be included in the final movie.
    Rather than immediately making <strong>copies</strong> of those clips,
	the system stores the <strong>time offsets</strong>
    from each clip, allowing the producer to experiment with different edits, all
    while pulling the video from the original sources.  When the video is
    to be viewed, the EDL is consulted and the video is constructed from its individual
    component clips.  In this way, the original sources and all the
	instructions about how to assemble the film from the originals are retained.
  <a id="note-28-6385" class="footnote" href="#footnote-28-6385">28</a></p>

  <p>By contrast, when a quotation is shown on television or in print, the
    quoting author makes a copy of the original and doesn't provide any
    instructions on how the clip fits within the original, making
    it difficult (or at least inconvenient for) the reader to
    gather the fuller perspective.</p>

  <p>Nelson envisions
  Xanadu® allowing authors to transclude content –
  <span class="highlight"><strong>embedding text and multimedia
    from across the internet</strong></span> and combine them in a
    way so that all the citations to the original sources remain intact and all connections
    are made visible. Because the system proposes an automatic rights
    management system, the author doesn’t need to track down the copyright holders.
  All copyright holders are paid because the viewer’s computer follows
  links to the original and pays the original creator as they download
  the original.</p>

    alt="Video Editing: Clapperboard" width="250" height="267" />
  <div class="caption">Video Editing: Clapperboard</div>
  </div>
  <p>This means that embedding could move beyond just the basic form of
  embedding a YouTube video in a web page, as I did at the
  opening of this piece with the Paul Saffo video. Instead, in Nelson’s system, I could
  <strong>embed text from other documents</strong> in my own document,
  but the system would maintain a record of those links, allowing all readers
  to view the original sources, and showing the context from which they were taken.
  I could also grab clips of videos from all around the web and incorporate
  them in one of my own videos. The links back to the original
  videos would be preserved; and readers could trace the context
  of the clips, much as they can view the context of the textual
  quotations in this piece.</p>

  <p>So much of the practice of *video reporting* revolves around the
  decisions of the creators or producers of a piece about <strong>where
  to make a cut</strong>. In politics, much of the effort is made to find a
  short clip that can be excerpted into a news story. Voters would be able to
  better contextualize the stories if they could view prior events.</p>

  <p>Trevor Noah of the “Daily Show” shows 2 stories from the Presidential
    Campaign that rely on poorly-sourced quotations.</p>
  <iframe src="https://media.mtvnservices.com/embed/mgid:arc:video:comedycentral.com:a580c339-6ce5-4f7c-a9f6-93097a884675"
        width="512" height="288" allowfullscreen="true">
  </iframe>

  <p>Imagine how radically different things would be if every content
  producer could source and publish their material in such a way that the
  viewer could <strong>pause the video and <span class="highlight">rewind
  past the clip’s starting point</span></strong>. Viewers would
  then see the content <strong>before the cut was made</strong>. Such a
  system is possible, and it is part of the vision Nelson
  advocates.<a id="permanent-addresses"></a></p>

  </div>
  <h4>The Issue of Address Granularity</h4>
  <p>Nelson envisioned Xanadu allowing the compilation of content from around
    the internet &mdash; remixing on a grand scale &mdash; all made possible for text, and
    video because <strong>each letter</strong> of each word and <strong>each video
    frame has its own <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/granular">"granular"</a> address</strong>,
    whereas on the web <span class="highlight">the only types of
    content that have their own addresses are pages</span> (the entire page),
    and files.</p>

  <h4>Postal Addresses</h4>
  <p>If you look at the physical world, the standardization of American postal
    addresses happened much more recently than many people think.</p>

  <blockquote cite="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/06/the-most-interesting-story-about-postal-addresses-you-have-ever-read/487160/"
  >It’s only within the last decade that every house has a street address,”
  says Nancy Pope, a historian at the Smithsonian National Postal Museum.</blockquote>

  <p><i>The Atlantic</i> ran a story about a British company called <a href="https://what3words.com/" target="_blank">What3Words</a>
  that that aims to solve this problem of <strong>granular physical addressing</strong> on a global scale.
  <strong>Not all roads</strong> in all countries <strong>are named</strong>;
  and <strong>not all named roads have street numbers</strong>.
  What3words aims to solve this problem by identifying all addresses on earth to within 3 meters using only
  a combination of 3 words. For example, The White House’s w3w address is:
  <a href="https://map.what3words.com/live.linen.slower" target="_blank">live.linen.slower</a>.</p>

  <p>Using only 3 words, citizens of Mongolia could send a letter to a recipient
    in another part of the country, even though that recipient does not
    have a numbered address on a named street.</p>


  <div class="alignright">
  <h4><a href="http://udanax.xanadu.com/green/febe/tumblers.html" target="_blank">Tumbler Example</a></h4>
  <div class="smaller">Chapters in each book<br />
  could be similarly numbered,<br />
  so that Chapter Five in Volume Three<br />
  would be represented as 3.5.<br />
  This could be extended arbitrarily,<br />
  so that 3.5.10.6 represents<br />
  Volume Three, Chapter Five,<br />
  Section Ten, Paragraph Six.</div>
  </div>
  <p>Like the United State’s early postal system’s coarse
  addressing system, our current web URLs lack a granularity that would
  allow us to permanently refer to an arbitrary location within a web page.
  This hampers our ability to build systems that remix and annotate content.
  By using an addressing system called
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumbler_(Project_Xanadu)" target="_blank">“Tumblers”</a>, Nelson’s system is
  able to keep track of different versions, as well as allow any selection
  of text or multimedia to be cited at a granular level.<p>

  <p>I’ve been discussing the big-picture, but if you dig into the
    technical details available in Ted’s book
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literary_Machines" target="_blank"
    >“Literary Machines”</a>, you can see how, as with the Pac-Man
    design, Xanadu® aims to achieve multiple design goals
    through substruction.</p>

  <h3>What is the Benefit of Good Media?</h3>
  <p>An early reader of a draft of this article still wasn’t clear
    about exactly how Xanadu® would make his life better. It’s hard
    to appreciate the transformative impact of some concepts unless
    you experience them yourself.</p>

  <h4>Visualizing "Connectivity"</h4>
    <p><a href="https://vimeo.com/36579366#1t50s" target="_blank">Bret Victor’s
    2012 speech to the Canadian University Software Engineering Conference</a>
    provides an illustration of the benefits of systems that increase
    "connectivity" by eliminating the need for creators to be able to
    visualize so much in their heads. Victor gives examples of how great
    tools can make a difference for computer programmers, animators, and
    electrical engineers by providing real-time feedback and eliminating
    the gap in the act -&gt; test feedback cycle.</p>

  <h4>Better Conceptualizing Numbers</h4>
  <p>One way of thinking about Xanadu® is that the connectivity it allows
  is like the adoption of Arabic numbers in place of
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals" target="_blank">Roman numerals</a>.
  Roman numerals were widely used up until the middle ages, despite the
  <a href="https://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2006/08/16/roman-numerals-and-arithmetic/" target="_blank"
  >difficulty they pose for tasks like multiplication</a>.

  <blockquote cite="https://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2006/08/16/roman-numerals-and-arithmetic/">Multiplication using roman numerals is not particularly easy or obvious. You can do the trivial thing, which is repeated addition. But it should be pretty obvious that that's not practical for large numbers.</blockquote>

  <p>It was only with the introduction of the
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_numerals" target="_blank"
  >Hindi-Arabic numbers</a> that large-scale multiplication tasks
  could be easily undertaken.</p>

  <p>The task for our present media is not representing numbers
    in a way that makes multiplication easier, but representing
    text, audio, and video in a way that allows the reader to view the
    full context without leaving the medium's “present” to consult
    some additional source.The fact that authors and video creators do
    not have a medium which allows the reader/viewer to access
  the full context of a text or video forces creators to make choices,
  often abbreviating the citation for sake of brevity or "punch".</p>

  <p>Alternately, it gives the creator/editor the option to
  spin a situation in an advantageous way, knowing that the audience
  will react in a preferred way to a clip removed from further context.</p>

  <p>In Computer Lib, Ted Talked about computers as "Thinker Toys"
  because they would allow computer users to engage in more complicated
  thought, much as Arabic numbers allows merchants to more easily multiply
  large numbers.</p>

  <p>Sometimes when I talk to people about these potential benefits of an
  advanced hypertext system like Xanadu®, they impose
  what I consider to be unrealistic expectations on it. It is true
  that the majority of web surfers will not use Xanadu’s® advanced
  features as authors. Asking most people to write a blog is too much,
  so for many people, shallow tools like Facebook and Twitter
  are sufficient. But we live in a world with immense talent, where
  the majority of all quality content is created by a minority of people.
  What we need is not a huge number
  of authors, but better tools for those authors with something to say.
  What we need is a way to financially support the creative people we
  do have, or more optimistically, all those authors we could have
  were the economics viable.</p>

  <p>Nelson writes that the effect of the Wired article was that:</p>
  <blockquote cite="http://www.hyperland.com/trollout.txt">we had no access to respect or funding, even in the dot-com feeding frenzy that was underway; and above all to deny us any credit for the thinking behind the World Wide Web.</blockquote>

  <p>After Wolf’s *condemning* article, Nelson went to <strong>Japan</strong>,
  where he still had many admirers, and wrote a Ph.D. thesis at
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keio_University" target="_blank">
  Keio University</a>. The thesis is dated January 10, 2002.  A few
  years ago I sought out a copy through the interlibrary system; and I found
  that Japanese academic standards are different than American, making
  the thesis a private document, rather than a public one.  Nelson shared a copy
  of the thesis with me privately, but it was not
  until this year (January 2017) that the thesis became publicly
  available.</p>

  <h3>Motivation for Hypertext</h3>
  <p>Finally, other than blaming Nelson for the failure at AutoDesk,
  one interesting theory Wolf floats in the Wired article is the idea
  that Nelson’s motivation for creating Xanadu® was his atypical cognitive style,
  <a id="note-31-6385" class="footnote" href="#footnote-31-6385">31</a>
  citing what Nelson calls his <q cite="https://www.wired.com/1995/06/xanadu/">hummingbird mind</q>:

  <blockquote cite="https://www.wired.com/1995/06/xanadu/">His great inspiration was to imagine a computer program that could keep track of all the divergent paths of his thinking and writing. To this concept of branching, nonlinear writing, Nelson gave the name hypertext.</blockquote>

      </a></h3>
  </div>
  <div id="what-would-xanadu-be-like" class="panel-collapse collapse">
  <div class="panel-body">
    <div class="alignright">
        <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/openpolitics.com/media/img/ted-nelson-blog/tabbed-browsing-tabs-small.png" alt="Tabbed browsing" width="400" />
        <div class="caption"><a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/josephbernstein/meet-the-man-who-invented-tabs?utm_term=.jyKM6LrlJ#.fr2Dy086W">
          Tabbed-browsing: invented in 1997</a>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p>One key feature of Xanadu® is that you must be able to see <strong>more
    than a single page at a time.</strong> The world wide web of the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_(web_browser)"
    target="_blank">Andreessen browser</a> allows only a single page to be
    open at once. Sure you can open multiple tabs, but <span class="highlight">as you switch between
	tabs, the previously open tab disappears</span>.  You can open multiple windows, but for longer documents,
    the visible connection to the original is lost, making it difficult to
    locate the context within the cited document where a quotation was
	sourced. It is possible, but it is like multiplying
	Roman numerals — a task that is possible, but infrequently
	attempted because of its practicality.</p>

    <p>Ted argues, and I agree, that being able to browse a single document,
    while at the same time having the <strong>contextual citations
    appear automatical to the right</strong> (in parallel) would have a transformative
    effect on readers; and creators would be rewarded for providing an
    <strong>"expanded expressiveness"</strong> that cites sources rather
	than wallowing in 140-character Twitter-like catchiness.</p>

    <p>A second major benefit of Xanadu® would be the ability to <strong>remix
    content</strong> while <strong>compensating the creators</strong>. Our
    current advertising-supported web culture has resulted in a competition
    for advertising eyeballs that leads to a
    "<strong>clickbait culture</strong>", where content creators compete
    to attract the most clickthroughs. Because the content is “free”,
    the content is “cheap”. A system with
    “<a href="http://transcopyright.org/hcoinRemarks-D28.html"
    target="_blank"><strong>micropayments</strong></a>”
    (a word coined by Nelson) would support a broader class of creative
    professionals, rather than the hollowing-out that has happened
    instead. In fact, Nelson envisioned <span class="highlight">a whole new class
    of creative people</span> whose work would be supported
    by micropayments. (*source*)</p>

    <div class="alignright">
        <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/openpolitics.com/media/img/ted-nelson-blog/garmin-nuvi-2497LMT-gps-small.jpg" alt="“Garmin" />
        <div class="caption"><a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Garmin-nuvi2497LMT-GPS-Unit/22960504" target="_blank">
          Garmin GPS Receiver</a>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>A third benefit of Xanadu® would come from new uses of information
    made possible by Xanadu’s® granular addressing system. Much as
    <strong>GPS transforms</strong> activities from farming, to travel, to
    geotagging photographs, a granular address system like Xanadu’s®
    would allow:</p>

    <ul class="disc">
      <li>People to <strong>fact-check</strong> documents, by annotating a
        specific sentence, phrase, or number in an article.</li>
     	<li>Search engines to find the best “pro” and “con” arguments that
        reference a particular line in an essay. Right now authors can
        cite or write a counter argument for a particular page, but
        granular addressing would allow authors to highlight a particular
        word and make a comment or post. This sort of advance has been
		attempted on a small scale on sites like <a target="_blank"
		href="https://medium.com/">Medium.com</a> and
		<a target="_blank" href="https://qz.com/111748/you-can-now-leave-annotations-in-the-margins-of-quartz/"
		>Quartz</a>, but Xanadu would enable this sort of commenting
		on all documents.  Making all comments easily available to
		developers in a structured way would allow developers to
		compete to the create the best interface for filtering and
		displaying comments, much like the accessibility of HTML allowed
		programmers at Alta Vista, Yahoo, Bing, and Google to
		create a competitive market for search engines.  This competitive
		market for filtering content is what has made the web successful.
		More granular addressing would create expanded markets for
		good content.
      </li>
     	<li>Video creators could also easily grab a few seconds of a video
        while crediting the original, and allowing their readers to
        compensate all the creators and see the original context.
        Reduced friction in the acquisition and compensation of original
        content would benefit both creators and readers.
      </li>
    </ul>

  <h3>What do Xanadu® demos look like?</h3>
  <p>Xanadu® has never been widely deployed to a public network, but there
  are demonstrations that run on a single computer. As a demo of what
  his looks like, consider Ted’s demonstration of how
  <a href="https://archive.org/details/MoeJusteOrigins" target="_blank">“Origins”</a>,
  a piece by Moe Juste, interacts with several sources:</p>
  <div class="video-container"><iframe class="youtube"
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/En_2T7KH6RA" width="560" height="315"
    allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>
  </div>

  <p>Getting Web Browsers like Chrome or Internet Explorer to support
  viewing multiple sources in parallel is a major challenge. Nelson
  has continued work on his vision and his goal is to release his own
  editor and browser (called Possiplex). But since Nelson is not a
  programmer,<a id="note-32-6385" class="footnote" href="#footnote-32-6385">32</a>
  he is limited by the supply of programmers who collaborate with him.<a id="note-32-9876" class="footnote" href="#footnote-32-9876">32</a>
  As one demonstration of what Xanadu® could look like,
  one programmer, Nicholas Levin, was able to make a
  <a class="btn small" href="https://www.openpolitics.com/2014/04/24/xanadu-browser-demo-released/"
  target="_blank">demo</a> work <strong>within the constraints
  of the browser</strong>. One should note that though it loads slowly it
  does allow the reader to experience what it is like to view multiple
  texts in parallel. Ted’s vision was to develop the right backend design
  and allow programmers to develop multiple front-end browsers.
  The usability of these two prototypes would likely be improved,
  just as the competition among Netscape, Internet Explorer, Firefox,
  Chrome, Opera, and Safari has made old editions of these
  software programs seem antique.</p>

	<h3>An Example of Parallel Documents (Optional)</h3>
	<p>For a demonstration of the benefits of parallel documents,
	consider a short article I put together about <a target="_blank"
	href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/openpolitics.com/media/html/how-jesus-read-his-bible-luke-4-isaiah-61.html"
	>how the way Jesus read his “Bible”</a> angered his contemporaries
	(Isaiah 61) and almost ended his ministry on the very first day.</p>

  <p><a href="http://idlewords.com/about.htm" target="_blank">Maciej Cegłowski</a>
  writes that <a href="https://idlewords.com/talks/web_design_first_100_years.htm"
  target="_blank">the history of airplanes has been one of modest
  improvements in spite of grand visions</a> of the “planes of tomorrow”.
  Cegłowski describes the lofty plans for planes like the
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_2707" target="_blank">
  Boeing 2707</a>, a plane that was designed to transport
  <span class="highlight">250-300 passengers at <strong>
  <span style="white-space:nowrap">Mach 3</span></strong></span>.
  Decades later, we have no 2707 and are still serviced by the 747,
  the plane that was intended to buy Boeing time to release the 2707 in the
  1970s. Why? Part of the reason why we still have the 747 is that the
  public does not want to deal with sonic booms as aircraft fly overhead.
  Noise inside the cabin is a factor, as a concern for the ozone layer.
  There are definite physical limits that constrain the market for aircraft.</p>

  <p>Cegłowski also writes that the time taken by traveling from Switzerland
  to San Francisco (11 hours) is considered manageable; and people don’t
  think it worthwhile to reduce this.</p>
  <blockquote cite="https://idlewords.com/talks/web_design_first_100_years.htm">
    It took eleven hours and cost me around a thousand dollars. It was
    a long flight and kind of uncomfortable and boring. But I crossed the
    planet in half a day!

    Being able to get anywhere in the world in a day is really good enough.
    We complain about air travel but consider that for a couple of thousand
    dollars, you can go anywhere, overnight.
  </blockquote>

  <h3>Is Hypertext “Good Enough”?</h3>
  <p>Is hypertext like airplanes — destined for only modest improvements
  because it is already “good enough” — or is Ted Nelson’s unfulfilled
  vision still of value? Will the hypertext of 2060 be a slightly
  tweaked version of what we have today? To answer that question,
  consider whether the constraints on hypertext are
  <strong>physical and resource limitations</strong>, or
  <span class="highlight"><strong>conceptual</strong></span>?
  Alternatively consider the question – how much does media matter?</p>
  <div class="alignright">
      <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/openpolitics.com/media/img/ted-nelson-blog/kennedy-nixon-debate-1960-small.jpg"

      </div>
  </div>
  <p>Media theorists know that Marshall McLuhan said
  “The medium is the message”, meaning that the way a message is conveyed
  shapes how the message is experienced. (*source*) Famously,
  <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/us-presidents/kennedy-nixon-debates"
  target="_blank">radio listeners thought that Nixon won the 1960 debate</a>,
  while television viewers thought Kennedy had won.</p>

  <p>Our current media landscape lends itself well to a political
    candidate who is adept at using <a title="Technical limit drives twitter
    design: SMS limit of 160 characters results in twitter limit of 140
    characters" href="https://www.quora.com/Why-does-Twitter-limit-the-message-length-to-140-characters"
    target="_blank">140 character tweets</a> and provoking free media
    time, which can then circulate via Facebook. This is our generation’s
    version of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireside_chats"
    target="_blank">“Fireside chat”</a>. Today, topics which can be
    covered in a short catchy video may be critiqued, but it can be
    difficult to address subjects which require the evaluation of
    context, or more than 2 minutes of extended reading — hence the
    dominance of the overly simple solution to complex problems.</p>
  <p>As <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/05/coal-miners-americas-political-canaries/483491/" target="_blank">
    Andrew McGill wrote</a> in <i>The Atlantic</i>:</p>
  <blockquote cite="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/05/coal-miners-americas-political-canaries/483491/">
    This is the fundamental difference in how the two presumptive nominees
    approach challenges. Trump tends to focus on what he identifies as the
    problem—how America has been wronged and who is to blame. Jobs
    went overseas? End NAFTA. Worried about terror? Ban Muslims.
    The solution is usually simple: Just stop doing whatever the
    U.S. was doing before. The community will prosper.
  </blockquote>
  <p>Yet if McLuhan is right and <strong>
  <span class="highlight">the types of political candidates we field</span>
  is influenced so much by our media</strong>, it seems worthwhile to
  devote the resources necessary to design “more perfect” media.</p>

  <h3>Hypertext Faces Metcalfe’s Law</h3>
  <p>Given the scale of companies like Amazon.com, Google, and
  Facebook, the resources required to design an improved alternate version
  of hypertext are available, but the market for any such system is
  constrained by the <strong>network effects</strong> described
  by <strong>Metcalfe’s Law</strong>.</p>

  <div class="alignright">
  <img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9094" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/openpolitics.com/media/img/ted-nelson-blog/metcalfe-effect-small.png" alt="Metcalfe Network Effect Diagram" width="131" height="300" />
      <div class="caption">
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe%27s_law" target="_blank">Metcalfe’s Law</a>:
      2<sup>2</sup>=4
      5<sup>2</sup>=25
      12<sup>2</sup>=144
      1000<sup>2</sup>=1 million
  </div>
  </div>
  <p>Metcalfe’s Law states that the <strong>value</strong> of a network
  is proportional to the <strong>square of its connections</strong>.
  As an example, suppose that an inventor invented a new type of telephone
  that had clearer sound quality and required less energy than existing phones,
  but only ran on its own network. If this network had an existing
  install base of two users, the value of the connections
  would be 4. (*phrasing* *fact-check*) </p>

  <p>A network of 5 users would have 25 different possible connections.
  A network of 1000 users has 1 million possible connections. From
  this simple math, we can see that network effects make large
  existing networks deeply resistant to competition unless the
  competitor networks are cross-compatible.</p>

  <p>How many people would value an improved phone enough to switch to
  a system on which many of their friends and family were inaccessible?
  The value of the enhancements is more than offset by the loss of
  access to the existing network, just as the value of an alternative
  hypertext system would be limited if it lacked interoperability
  with the old.</p>

  <p>When I paid a visit to Ted and his new wife Lauren Sarno this past September,
  the purpose of my visit was partly to experience meeting the person who
  played such a significant role in the shaping of our present media
  landscape, but also to talk with both Ted and Lauren about plans for
  the launch of Ted's Ph.D. thesis this January.</p>

  <p>I found Ted charming, engaging, and very sharp, despite his 79 years; but while
  Ted talked freely about his ideas, he took little interest in strategy or
  business details, saying "I'm not a businessman".</p>

  <p>I had been talking to Ted about who he thought might be a good early adopter of
  Xanadu. My thinking was that academia might offer an audience that valued
  Xanadu's more sophisticated citation system; and many Universities are
  currently questioning the high price tag and durability of the
  existing electronic journals.</p>

  <p>It's probably too much to ask any one person to fill all the hats in a company &mdash;

  Steve Wozniak who <q cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Wozniaksingle-handedly">single-handedly created that Apple I</q>.
  Ted never had that type of partnership (footnote:

  (28:50)); but as I talked to Ted and Lauren, I did get a sense that Lauren was bringing
  something important to the marriage. Ted's beloved wife <a target="_blank"

  <h3>What could Ted Nelson learn from Tesla?</h3>

  </div>
  <p>Later as I was thinking about what sort of
  marketing strategy Xanadu should take, I was reminded how Tesla built
  themselves a market for electric cars.

  Several years ago, if you had the idea of starting a company to sell electric
  cars, you would have faced a problem of a marketing strategy &mdash; first, it's
  hard to produce an electric car that can go for more than 30 miles on a charge; and the
  cars are very expensive. How are you going to establish a customer base if the car
  costs $70,000 and has such a limited range? Simple, once you've identified a
  target market. Tesla marketed the vehicles to a group of early adopters as sports
  cars with an acceleration from 0-60 in under 3 seconds!</p>

  <p>After they proved themselves in the prestigious sports-car category
  and they had improved their cost-efficiency, they announced pre-sales of
  the $35,000 Model 3. Prospective buyers put down $1,000 deposits allowing Tesla
  to gauge the public's enthusiasm for the car. This also allows Tesla to get bulk
  discounts from suppliers and
  <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-tsla-model-3-makes-150703602.html"
  target="_blank">gives Tesla a free $10 billion loan</a>
  from customers. Xanadu needs to apply the same type of marketing
  insight to determine how to position itself.</p>

  <p>One place where experimentation could be done is in the market for
  <strong>e-books</strong> and <strong>apps</strong>. As mentioned earlier
  in this piece, creators are looking beyond the web for a medium that makes
  it easy to charge for their content, but the disadvantage of this is that
  <strong>authors can’t link deeply</strong> into other author’s e-books or apps.
  Meanwhile, the prevailing web model is hardly sustainable, requiring
  readers to sign up with every paid site they visit.</p>

  <p>What the publishing world needs is a system &mdash; like iTunes
  &mdash; that reduces the friction for creators to charge for
  their content, and that doesn't require every author to use their own checkout
  and payment platforms, while at the same time remaining permeable to linking
  and remixing.</p>

  <p>What is needed is a means of connecting these unlinked spaces together — a medium where
  <span class="highlight"><strong>creators can both get paid and get connected</strong></span>.
  This is an area where there is still a potential opening for a system like Xanadu.</p>

  <h3>Promoting the value of an Alternate System</h3>
  <p>The inertia of our present hypertext system is very high; and the
  argument for an alternate system has not been popularized enough to
  support an alternative market; so as a small demonstration of the
  potential value of fully-contextual documents, I’ve created some
  simple interim computer code that suggests some of the power of a more
  contextual document format, without requiring browsers to support
  viewing of multiple documents in parallel.</p>

  <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/188599152" width="800" height="500" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

  <a id="neotext_website_button" class="btn more medium" href="https://www.citeit.net/" target="_blank">
    CiteIt Website
  </a>

  <p>I call the technique of dynamically displaying the context
  surrounding a quotation <a href="https://www.citeit.net/"
  target="_blank">“CiteIt”</a>; and I’ve created the CiteIt javascript plugin
  for use throughout this article to demonstrate the
  context of quotations. If you click on one of the red arrows above or below
  a quote, the immediate context of the quote appears.  This context is
  looked up at the time the piece is written, stored in a
  JSON file on the Amazon S3 Cloud, and injected into
  the document by my javascript library.</p>

  <p>Unlike <a href="http://xanadu.com/" target="_blank">Xanadu®</a>,
  CiteIt currently <strong>does not feature parallelism</strong>,<a id="note-33-6385" class="footnote" href="#footnote-33-6385">33</a>
  but for phones and other small screens, there is not enough screen
  real-estate to display quotations with parallelism anyway.</p>

  <div class="alignright">
      <img src="//s3.amazonaws.com/openpolitics.com/media/img/ted-nelson-blog/winston-churchill-small.jpg"

      <div class="caption"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Churchill"
        target="_blank">Winston Churchill</a>, Britsh Prime Minister during WWII</div>
  </div>

  <p>If at some point an effort is made for a Xanadu-like system, a
  quote <a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2012/11/11/exhaust-alternatives/"
  target="_blank">apocryphally attributed to Winston Churchill</a>
  will be fulfilled:</p>

  <blockquote cite="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2012/11/11/exhaust-alternatives/">
  [They] will always do the right thing… after they’ve exhausted all the alternatives.
  </blockquote>

  <p>My hope for CiteIt is that it demonstrates the value of contextual
  quotation and serves as an impetus for the development of more advanced
  user interfaces that will eventually expand to feature full parallelism.

  <p>When we look at our media landscape,
  there is a tendency to see our current systems as "natural", or fixed;
  but by looking back at history we see that the technology we
  take for granted followed a path that could have been different.
  Ted Nelson's philosophy spurred him to develop a
  system that rejected the conventions of hierarchy and paper.
  The task of designing a new hypertext system was more difficult than
  he anticipated and his Xanadu system was "disrupted" by the web,
  which compromised on a simpler one-page-at-a-time paper-emulating paradigm.</p>

  <p>Ted Nelson was the first person to foresee a world fully-connected by
  hypertext, but he has not yet been able to
  describe it sufficiently, or to implement his ideas as software.
  For years, people have scoffed at him because his dreams were both
  difficult to understand and beyond his capabilities to implement. (footnote: he is not a programmer)</p>

  <p>Now at age 79, Ted is still pursuing his vision but with
  <a target="_blank" title="Volunteer as a Xanadu programmer." href="http://www.tednelson.com/volunteer">volunteer programmers</a>
  because he lacks a source of funding. This January, Nelson is releasing
  his most full description of Xanadu, his
  <a href="https://www.lulu.com/en/us/shop/theodor-holm-nelson/philosophy-of-hypertext/paperback/product-15v4z6r5.html" target="_blank">2002 Ph.D. thesis, 
 Intertwingled</a>,
  written at Keio University in Japan. Technical people will find write-ups
  filling several hundreds of pages of appendices.
  Historians and philosophers will find supporting documents describing the
  development of Ted's philosophy. The non-technical reader might do best by
  starting with Ted's autobiography &mdash;
  <a href="https://www.lulu.com/shop/ted-nelson/possiplex/paperback/product-14925222.html" target="_blank"><i>Possiplex</i></a> &mdash;
  which was published in 2011.</p>

  <p>I'll conclude with one final thought about the state of our media &mdash; Ours is a time when the
  talk in Silicon Valley swirls around the ideal of progressive
  <span class="highlight">“<strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disruptive_innovation" target="_blank">disruption</a></strong>”</span>
  and big dreams.
  Uber wants to disrupt the taxi industry. Google wants to disrupt the auto industry.
  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-06-09/welcome-to-larry-page-s-secret-flying-car-factories">
  Larry Page is investing $100 million in self-driving <strong>flying cars</strong></a>;
  and people talk about <a target="_blank" href="https://www.marketplace.org/2016/10/11/world/next-frontier-next-frontier"
  title="Marco Caceres said getting to Mars is going to cost trillions">spending trillions to go to Mars</a>.
  Everyone in the technology sector is looking for non-technical industries to “disrupt”
  at an enormous scale;
  but the question I pose concerns Silicon Valley's home turf &mdash; “<strong>Can anyone disrupt the web?</strong>
  Or is the web the one technology that is beyond disruption?”
  </p>

  <p>Ted Nelson's ambition is not so high as to entirely replace the web.
  Instead, at the end of "Philosophy of Hypertext" he says:</p>

  <blockquote cite="https://s3.amazonaws.com/openpolitics.com/media/html/ted-nelson/possiplex-page-125-126.html">
  The important question is whether these ideas can enable a
  principled and feasible alternative universe, beneficial
  even if implemented only in part, a potential zone of clarity
  in the chaos of the Web, desirable enough to be worth
  the uphill effort.
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote cite="https://read.citeit.net/mirror/www.openpolitics.com/media/html/ted-nelson/philosophy-of-hypertext-pg-126-127.html">Would it mean just too much overhead? We believed that like the hidden overhead of the Internet itself, such a structure will pay for itself manyfold.

We can see no other important agenda for hypertext.</blockquote>

  <h3 class="pad_top">More Information:</h3>
  <p>Ted Nelson has received little recognition and no royalties for his
  contributions to the internet.  He is now 79 years-old; and
  purchases of his self-published books will help fund his

This is quite complex since there are lots of nuances regarding things like comments, spacing, and presence and absence of markup which must then be handled. It also makes it quite difficult to reconstruct from the fragments a document potentially not even conforming to XML originally &#8212; documents do often contain errors in their construction. This fragmentation is typically done in order to coerce the information as originally structured to be indexed via relational database technology ..<a href="#note-34-6385" class="footnote-return">&#8617;</a></p></li><!--/#footnote-34.footnote--><li id="footnote-35-6385" class="footnote"><p> It would seem that academia and the publishing industry would have a common interest in creating such an alternate literary system. Magazine publishers already create apps for subscribers.  Book publishers publish books in e-book format.  All of these formats are closed systems which don&#8217;t interoperate.  If we continue in the direction of &#8220;walled gardens&#8221;, the web will be a momentary blip of openness on the historical timeline. Why not form a common venture to build a non-html-based alternative that is open to annotation and (paid) transclusion and deploy it as an app?<a href="#note-35-6385" class="footnote-return">&#8617;</a></p></li><!--/#footnote-35.footnote--></ol></div><!--/#footnotes-->
